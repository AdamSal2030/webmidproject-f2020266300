                    <h3>Thomas shelby</h3>
                    <p> Tommy is a kind of a man who believes his family is his strength, rather than thinking they’re his weakness. He knows how to keep his calm even in the most panic-inducing situations. From the cut of his suit to his famous hairstyle, Thomas knows how to carry himself and is well-dressed at all times. If something is not strategically valuable in his eyes, Tommy doesn’t pursue it, just like the women in his life. Shelby is also quick in earning the respect of Winston Churchill, who often makes an appearance in the show. </p>
